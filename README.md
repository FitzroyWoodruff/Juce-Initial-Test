# Juce Initial Test

I decided to brush back up on my C++ skills. I haveing touched C++ for a few years, focusing most of my energy on Javascript, Java, and Python.
I recently got into the hobby of making music playing with DAWs and decided to try and make my on C++ plugin using the Juce framework.
